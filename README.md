# NativeNADH_PM2A

#### Introduction
    The protein sequence database involved in article "Deep learning-enabled identification of NADH-dependent native imine reductases"
    Tested_95.fasta stores samples we ultimately selected for the sampling experiment (totally 95 proteins).
    Potential_291.fasta contains the result of not performing a Calibration operation (totally 291 proteins).
    3-HIBADH_157306.fasta is our expanded 3-HIBADH database and also our retrieval scope (totally 157306 proteins).
